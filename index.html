    <h4>The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded
        for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing-- at least, what untattooed parts might remain-- I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into
        a congenial admeasurement of the whale. (Herman Melville, Moby Dick, 1851 449)
        <br>
    </h4>

    <p>Ismael, Mellville’s narrator, carries with him a single continuous surface on all of his journeys, his skin. Unlike other surfaces—paper, objects, clothing—the surface of his skin will travel with him where ever he goes. Cleverly, he uses this as
        the surface on which to document his journeys. It is a repository of all the information and experiences that he wishes to catalog and it is always accessible. The skeleton of a massive whale has been translated into a set of “admeasurements”
        on his right arm, leaving aside the “odd inches”. This translation of the whale into a set of organized marks on his arm is a translation and a distillation of massive amounts of information. Shape, fractions, color, texture and odor have all
        been omitted from this documentation. He has reduced the representation of the whale into what he deems to be the most important—its size—and forever embossed it upon his body. This is an act of recording and it is also an act of analysis through
        reduction and translation. Similarly, this semester we will focus on documenting and analyzing a set of inquiries—capturing and distilling information onto our version of Ismael’s skin—a catalog. </p>
